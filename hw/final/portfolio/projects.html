        <p>For this project, we were assigned to design a billboard house, 60’ wide, 20’ high, and 16’ long, that was inspired by 2 architects’ different styles of design. Our client wanted three bedrooms, one master and two guest, and two bathrooms.
          Specifically for this space, our clients wanted a space that was modern but also relaxing due to the nature around the location.
          We first did collages of the architects we were using- Tadao Ando and Michael Graves. They had very different styles, so we decided to do Ando’s sleek and modern design on the exterior, and Graves’ colorful and eclectic style on the interior. We
          began sketching floor plans and exterior ideas, working both together and individually. We each came up with one final design that we individually liked. Using these two ideas, we created three separate study models; two of our ideas, and one
          combining them by putting one as the first floor and the other as the second. After we chose the combination idea, we made modifications and more detailed plans.
          Once we had our final design, we split up; one of us worked on the AutoCAD floor plans, while the other worked on the SketchUp and interiors. We used concrete and wood for the outside to make it sleek, using black and blue accents that gave
          color to the exterior while still keeping the modern aspects. On the inside, we used light concrete floors that emphasized the colorful wallpapers and paints. We created a fun space that is also modern, which was what our clients wanted. Once we
          did the SketchUp Model and AutoCAD, we started the physical model. Using the laser cutter and extensions to trace faces, we cut out the walls of the model and assembled them. Once the physical model made of chipboard was constructed, we placed
          it on the pole that would support the house.
          Overall the project was really fun to do even if it was stressful at times. It was our first time designing a real home and, along with all the sudden memos and reworks of what the clients wanted, it felt like we were really designing it for
          somebody to live in. The hardest part of the project was the initial design process and trying to agree on an idea but also fit all the wants and needs of our client. But, even with all the criteria and constraints that we had to meet, we
          somehow made it happen and it looks really nice. We worked really well on the project together, being able to bounce ideas off one another and delegate different tasks with the knowledge that we would both put the our best effort into it and
          really cared about the finished product.</p>

        <p>The subject of this project was the artist, Kandinsky. Kandinsky was known for being one of the pioneers of abstract modern art. He exploited the evocative interrelation between color and form to create an aesthetic experience that engaged the
          sight, sound, and emotions of the public. Kandinsky was born on December 4, 1866, in Moscow. From 1886 through 1892 he studied law and economics at the University of Moscow, where he lectured after graduation. In 1896 he declined a teaching
          position in order to study art in Munich with Anton Azbe from 1897 to 1899 and at the Kunstakademie with Franz von Stuck in 1900. He developed an obsession with Monet led him to explore his own creative concepts of color on canvas, which were
          sometimes controversial among his contemporaries and critics, but Kandinsky emerged as a respected leader of the abstract art movement in the early 20th century.
          The components of this project were to interpret a piece of his art as a 3D object, whether it be one element or the entire piece. Everyone got a different piece of his art. I got “Schwarz und Violett” which has many triangles, lines, and weird
          circles. We had to make 3 study models of our our 3D object and they had to fit in the constraints of a 3x3x3 cube and touch all of the faces at least once. We then would take our favorite out of the 3 study models and blow it up to fit in a
          6x6x6 cube with the same rule that it had to touch all the faces at least once. This was our first experience actually having to make study models as it was only a suggestion before. It was difficult trying to understand that study models are
          supposed to be quick and fast and not 100% perfect and that's what I had trouble with at first. The most difficult part of this project was the time constraint we had since all of our other projects had very, very, very flexible due dates.</p>

      <aside class="summaryp5">
        <p>For this project we worked in groups of 3 to build a 3 story 30'x30'x30' micro-living cube. The cube had to have three separate dwellings inside and no dwelling could occupy more than 50% of the floor space. Each dwelling had to have space on
          at least two floors because all of them had to be accessed by the center hallway. Many aspects of this project were similar to the others in which we had to use Sketch Up, CAD, hand-drafting and make a physical model. With this project we also
          had to dive a little deeper into things like green building elements. Normally we would just say that they were there but this time we had to write a paper and do a little research about how it would make the cube more green.
          Previously for projects we would either work by ourselves or with one other teammate and with that teammate we would do everything together. This project gave us more independence while still having teammates to rely on. The only time we needed
          the other group members was is the beginning while splitting the cube and towards the middle when we were deciding which floor each person would draw on CAD and hand draft. It was easy to work with my team because we're all laid back and didn't
          disagree on anything. If something went wrong it was always an easy fix so it was nice. Plus, if we had any questions we could always ask our teammates. Overall, we were able the push through and complete the project efficiently.
          I really enjoyed this project because it was the first time where we really got to go in and design a residence independently. It was also a really good way to use every skill that we've learned this year and mash it all into one project.</p>

      <aside class="summaryp4">
        <p>This project started with us learning about and defining seventeen architectural terms. After finding the definitions we made index cards which had various representations of each word such as a picture from the internet and a sketch. Once
          this was done we started planning and sketching out ideas for our chipboard models. The first model was meant to display two different words, one in 2D and one in 3D. The second model is as meant to display three words, one in 2D, one in 3D, and
          one to represent the contrast between the 2D and 3D view.

          For my first model I had the terms emphasis and hierarchy. The 2D view represented emphasis because all of the boxes and lines were on one side of the chipboard base, compared to the other side which had none. The 3D view represented hierarchy
          in many ways. The thickness of the boxes vertically was shrunk as it went down each box. With the 1x1.5 boxes the first stack had 3 while the next stack had 2 and then the smaller hollow boxes only had 1.

          For my second model I had the terms scale, contrast, and repetition. The 2D view represented the repetition because the pattern of the boxes repeats and so do the lines on either side. The 3D view represented scale as one half of the model was 1
          inch while the other half was all 3 inches. I used contrast to show the relationship between the 2D and 3D which is displayed by the white matte board on top of the black foam core. So in 2D view all you can see is white but in 3D you see the
          black.

          Compared to previous projects this one was more demanding and challenged us to get even more out of the box than usual since we had constraints and conditions that needed to be met. The amount of work it took to get to the final product was also
          more strenuous than our other projects, since we had to sketch, model on sketchup, create physical models, and draft by hand and on CAD.</p>

        <p>This project was really hard to do. First, we had to work with a partner and for me, it wasn't hard to get along with them and to agree on one idea. The one thing that was bad, was that I did a lot of the writing since they weren't good at it.
          Compared to the last project this one was more stressful because there was an actual criteria we had to follow and it required a whole bunch of different elements to finish it. The main thing that was hard to do was coming up with different
          ideas because we found one we really liked but still had to find other ideas. It was also hard presenting these ideas and getting our favorite rejected and then having to come up with a whole other idea. We also challenged ourselves by choosing
          a really old disaster, which meant that we were limited to resources that were available during that time. Not only that, but since our country isn't that developed we were even more limited on resources. We had to go through many variations of
          the same idea because of our small supply on resources. Overall this project was exciting to do and I hope I survive the rest.</p>

        <p>The concept of my structure is based on a really cool shell that I found a picture of on the internet. Since it's a shell I decided that it would be an aquarium called the “Shell Shock Aquarium” since shell shock is a term used during World
          War 1 to describe PTSD before PTSD had a name an aquarium would be perfect. During my research I found out that aquariums are actually proven to calm you down by lowering stress, anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate. In addition to that,
          aquariums also help relieve muscle tension and symptoms of Alzheimer's, which makes them perfect for elders and veterans. Aquariums also help children with learning and developmental challenges. So, besides it being just a regular aquarium for a
          day out with your family, my aquarium will also provide tours, classes, and activities for elders and children who need a little extra help to relax and learn. My idea is for the structure to be located near homes for senior citizens and/or
          hospitals so that senior citizens, children, and people who can’t get very far from the hospital can easily get there. It also gives the elderly and patients a chance to interact with the public, since a lot of them don't usually get contact to
          the outside world besides their families. Since, the structure is going to be helpful to elders and hospital patients, it will also provide ramps and elevators to accommodate them, it’ll also be helpful for parents with a stroller. “Shell Shock”
          Aquarium will be a helpful place for everyone’s individual needs.</p>
