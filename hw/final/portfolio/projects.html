        <p>For this project, we were assigned to design a billboard house, 60’ wide, 20’ high, and 16’ long, that was inspired by 2 architects’ different styles of design. Our client wanted three bedrooms, one master and two guest, and two bathrooms.
          Specifically for this space, our clients wanted a space that was modern but also relaxing due to the nature around the location.
          We first did collages of the architects we were using- Tadao Ando and Michael Graves. They had very different styles, so we decided to do Ando’s sleek and modern design on the exterior, and Graves’ colorful and eclectic style on the interior.

          Once we had our final design, we split up; one of us worked on the AutoCAD floor plans, while the other worked on the SketchUp and interiors. It was our first time designing a real home and, along with all the sudden memos and reworks of what
          the clients wanted, it felt like we were really designing it for
          somebody to live in.</p>

        <p>The subject of this project was the artist, Kandinsky. Kandinsky was known for being one of the pioneers of abstract modern art. He exploited the evocative interrelation between color and form to create an aesthetic experience that engaged
          the
          sight, sound, and emotions of the public.
          The components of this project were to interpret a piece of his art as a 3D object, whether it be one element or the entire piece. We had to make 3 study models of our our 3D object and they had to fit in the constraints of a 3x3x3 cube and
          touch all of the faces at least once. We then would take our favorite out of the 3 study models and blow it up to fit in a
          6x6x6 cube with the same rule that it had to touch all the faces at least once. </p>

          at least two floors because all of them had to be accessed by the center hallway. </p>

        <p>This project started with us learning about and defining seventeen architectural terms. After finding the definitions we made index cards which had various representations of each word such as a picture from the internet and a sketch. The
          first model was meant to display two different words, one in 2D and one in 3D. The second model is as meant to display three words, one in 2D, one in 3D,
          and
          one to represent the contrast between the 2D and 3D view.

          For my first model I had the terms emphasis and hierarchy. The 2D view represented emphasis because all of the boxes and lines were on one side of the chipboard base, compared to the other side which had none. The 3D view represented hierarchy
          in many ways. The thickness of the boxes vertically was shrunk as it went down each box. With the 1x1.5 boxes the first stack had 3 while the next stack had 2 and then the smaller hollow boxes only had 1.

          For my second model I had the terms scale, contrast, and repetition. The 2D view represented the repetition because the pattern of the boxes repeats and so do the lines on either side. The 3D view represented scale as one half of the model was
          1
          inch while the other half was all 3 inches. I used contrast to show the relationship between the 2D and 3D which is displayed by the white matte board on top of the black foam core. So in 2D view all you can see is white but in 3D you see the
          black.

        <p>This project was really hard to do. First, we had to work with a partner and for me, it wasn't hard to get along with them and to agree on one idea. The one thing that was bad, was that I did a lot of the writing since they weren't good at
          it.
          Compared to the last project this one was more stressful because there was an actual criteria we had to follow and it required a whole bunch of different elements to finish it. The main thing that was hard to do was coming up with different
          ideas because we found one we really liked but still had to find other ideas. It was also hard presenting these ideas and getting our favorite rejected and then having to come up with a whole other idea. We also challenged ourselves by choosing
          a really old disaster, which meant that we were limited to resources that were available during that time. Not only that, but since our country isn't that developed we were even more limited on resources. We had to go through many variations of
          the same idea because of our small supply on resources. Overall this project was exciting to do and I hope I survive the rest.</p>

        <p>The concept of my structure is based on a really cool shell that I found a picture of on the internet. Since it's a shell I decided that it would be an aquarium called the “Shell Shock Aquarium” since shell shock is a term used during World
          War 1 to describe PTSD before PTSD had a name an aquarium would be perfect. During my research I found out that aquariums are actually proven to calm you down by lowering stress, anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate. In addition to that,
          aquariums also help relieve muscle tension and symptoms of Alzheimer's, which makes them perfect for elders and veterans. Aquariums also help children with learning and developmental challenges. So, besides it being just a regular aquarium for
          a
          day out with your family, my aquarium will also provide tours, classes, and activities for elders and children who need a little extra help to relax and learn. My idea is for the structure to be located near homes for senior citizens and/or
          hospitals so that senior citizens, children, and people who can’t get very far from the hospital can easily get there. It also gives the elderly and patients a chance to interact with the public, since a lot of them don't usually get contact to
          the outside world besides their families. Since, the structure is going to be helpful to elders and hospital patients, it will also provide ramps and elevators to accommodate them, it’ll also be helpful for parents with a stroller. “Shell
          Shock”
          Aquarium will be a helpful place for everyone’s individual needs.</p>
